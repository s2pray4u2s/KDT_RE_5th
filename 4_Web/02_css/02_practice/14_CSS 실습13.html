        <h1>The Kid LAROI, Justine Bieber - STAY (novel ver.)</h1>
        <div class="line">He always found himself frozen in the same kind of night.</div>
        <div class="line">The city was loud, but his room was quiet—too quiet.</div>
        <div class="line">His phone lay face down beside him, as if it could still feel her presence.</div>
        <div class="line">Since she left, nothing felt stable.</div>
        <div class="line">He tried to drown the silence with noise, laughter, and strangers’ voices,</div>
        <div class="line">but the moment he was <span>alone</span>, her absence grew heavier.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="line">He knew the truth, even if he hated it.</div>
        <div class="line">He wasn’t good at holding onto love.</div>
        <div class="line">He spoke before thinking, ran before understanding,</div>
        <div class="line">and mistook <span>fear</span> for affection.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="line">She once told him he loved her hardest when he was afraid of losing her.</div>
        <div class="line">At the time, he denied it.</div>
        <div class="line">Now, the words echoed endlessly in his mind.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="line">He made a thousand <span>promises</span> in his head—</div>
        <div class="line">that he would change,</div>
        <div class="line">that he would be calmer,</div>
        <div class="line">that he would learn how to love without hurting.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="line">But promises meant nothing if she never came back to hear them.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="line">So he waited.</div>
        <div class="line">Not with confidence, but with hope thin as glass.</div>
        <div class="line">Every night felt like <span>tonight</span> might be different,</div>
        <div class="line">like maybe this time she would return.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="line">He didn’t ask for forgiveness anymore.</div>
        <div class="line">He didn’t ask for another chance.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="line">He only wanted one thing—</div>
        <div class="line">that she would <span>stay</span>.</div>
    </div>
